# PSC3M5-GPIO-Interrupt-Based-LED-Control-System-Infineon-PSC3M5-EVK-
This project demonstrates how to use **GPIO interrupts** on the **Infineon PSC3M5 EVK** to control onboard LEDs using physical push buttons.   It is a simple yet powerful example of handling asynchronous hardware events using the **Peripheral Driver Library (PDL)** of the PSC3 family.
